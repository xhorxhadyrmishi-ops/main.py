# 1 we display the list in this format 3-23-12-7-9-15-8-44-27-30
# the *my_list is to "spread out" the elements of the list

# 2. Display the list in reverse order with the same format in 1.

# 3. Find the smallest and largest elements using manual comparisons inside a for loop.
# we assume that the first element (index 0) is the smallest and the largest
smallest = my_list[0]
largest = my_list[0]
for num in my_list:  # the loop checks every number in the list

    if num > largest:  # same thing but for the largest number
        largest = num

print("Smallest number in thw list :", smallest)  # prints out the result

# 4. Calculate the sum and average using the loop.
total = 0
# we add each number to total to calculate sum
for num in my_list:
    total = total + num

# Calculate average
average = total / len(my_list)

# 6. Sort the list and display as the same format in 1.  Tip: By repeatedly finding the smallest, moving it into a new list, and removing it from the working copy. You may use built-in pop and append functions but don't use build in sort function.
sorted_list = []  # we make an empty list for the sorted my_list

while len(my_list) > 0:  # this loop will run True until the og list has no more elements
    # We assume first element (index 0) is smallest element
    smallest = my_list[0]

    # we find the actual smallest
    for num in my_list:
        if num < smallest:
            smallest = num

    # then move the smallest to the new sorted list, for this i used .append instead of .insert so that the next number gets added at the end instead of at a specific index
    sorted_list.append(smallest)

    # delete smallest from my_list using its index
    del my_list[my_list.index(smallest)]

# print the sorted list in the format of task 1
print(*sorted_list, sep="-")
