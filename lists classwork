#1. Based on the Student and Grade Class Assignment from last week. Create a program that can sort lists and print the information in the lists with grades in descending order in the format: [student name] - [grade].
#2. Based on the Student and Grade Class Assignment from last week. Create a program that will find the largest element in a list using loops. Display a congratulatory message for the student with the highest grade

#3. Create a program that will take a list and a number from the user. The program will check the list and if the number is part of the list, it will output the index, otherwise it will output “Number not in list”

numbers = input("Enter numbers separated by commas: ").split(",")
num = input("Enter a number: ")

        print("Number found at index", i)

#4. Write a program that will remove duplicate values from a list.

unique = []
for n in numbers:
    if n not in unique:
        unique.append(n)

print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Without duplicates:", unique)

#5. Create a program that will implement a lottery system. The system will randomly select 6 numbers from 1-49 and store them in a list. The user will be asked to input 6 numbers and the program will check how many correct numbers the user has found. 1 correct one gets 1 point, 2 correct gets 2 points, 3 correct gets 4 points and so on.

#setting up the random lottery numbers

import random #this will import 6 random numbers
lottery = []
while len(lottery) < 6:
    num = random.randint(1, 49)
    if num not in lottery:
        lottery.append(num)

# Get 6 numbers from the user
user = []
print("Enter 6 numbers between 1 and 49")

#chexk if the numbers are in the lottery numbers list
while len(user) < 6:
    n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if n not in user:
        user.append(n)

# Counting the correct numbers
correct = 0
for number in user:
    if number in lottery:
        correct = correct + 1

# Adding the points
if correct == 1:
    points = 1
elif correct == 2:
    points = 2
elif correct == 3:
    points = 4
elif correct == 4:
    points = 8
elif correct == 5:
    points = 16
elif correct == 6:
    points = 32
else:
    points = 0

#Printing thw results
print("Lottery numbers:", lottery)
print("Your numbers:", user)
print("Correct numbers:", correct)
print("Points:", points)
