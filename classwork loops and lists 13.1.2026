#1. Write a program that will continuously get a number input from the user until they enter 0 and you will display how many odd and even numbers they entered

odd = 0
even = 0

while True:
    n = int(input("Enter number:"))
    if n == 0:
        break
    if n % 2 == 0:
        even += 1
    else:
        odd += 1

    print("Odd:", odd)
    print("Even:", even)

#2. Write a program that will calculate the layers of a pyramid based on how many blocks the user enters as input. For example if the user inputs 6, the output will be 3 layers. The pyramid will have 1 block in the top most layer and will have one extra block in each subsequent layer.

blocks=int(input('enter the number of blocks'))

top=1
layers=0
while blocks>0:
    if top>blocks:
        break
    blocks= blocks-top
    top=top+1
    layers=layers+1

print(layers)
print('the remaining bricks',blocks)

#it continues to ask the user for input until a certain condition you decide is met
#saves all student data in lists.
# Display all students names, all grades, and all students with their respective grades.
# (Optional) Implement a method to sort the grades of the students in ascending and descending order.

names = []
scores = []
grades = []
student_name = ""
while student_name != "0" :
    student_name = input("Enter student name: ")
    score = int(input("Enter test score"))
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print("invalid score number, score between 0-100")
    elif score > 50:
        print("you have passed")
    else:
        print("you have failed")

    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        grade = "D"
    elif score >= 50:
        grade = "E"
    else:
        grade = "F"
